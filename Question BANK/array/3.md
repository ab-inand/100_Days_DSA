# Remove the Last Task from a List

## ❓ Problem Statement

Imagine you are developing a task management system for a team. One of the features requested by the team is the ability to remove the last task added to the list. Your task is to write a program that takes a list of task IDs and removes the last task from the list. After removing the last task, the program should display the updated list of tasks.

-----

## 📥 Input Format

  - **First line:** An integer `N`, representing the number of tasks in the list.
  - **Second line:** `N` space-separated integers, representing the task IDs.

-----

## 📤 Output Format

  - The output prints the updated list of tasks as space-separated integers after removing the last task.

-----

## 📋 Constraints

  - `1 <= n <= 15`
  - `1 <= task IDs <= 100`

-----

## 🧪 Sample Cases

### Sample 1

**Input:**

```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 
```

### Sample 2

**Input:**

```
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

**Output:**

```
5 4 3 2 
```

## 💡 Solution

### Explanation

The logic to solve this problem is straightforward. The program first reads the total number of tasks (`N`) and then reads all the task IDs into an array. To "remove" the last task, we simply need to print one less element than we read. A `for` loop iterates from the first element up to, but not including, the last element (`i < n - 1`). This effectively displays the list without its final member.

### C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;
    // Read the number of tasks.
    std::cin >> n;

    // Based on constraints (n <= 15), a fixed-size array is safe.
    int tasks[15];

    // Read the task IDs into the array.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> tasks[i];
    }

    // Print the updated list by iterating n-1 times,
    // which effectively omits the last element.
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        std::cout << tasks[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
