# Count Words Starting with a Specific Letter

## ❓ Problem Statement

Sarath is developing a program that counts how many words in a list start with a specific letter. The program should take user input for the number of words, the words themselves, and the letter of interest. Finally, it should output the count of words that start with the given letter.

-----

## 📥 Input Format

  - **First line:** An integer `n`, representing the number of words.
  - **Next `n` lines:** Each line contains a single word (a string).
  - **Last line:** A single character `letter`, the letter to check at the start of each word.

-----

## 📤 Output Format

  - The output prints a single integer representing the number of words that start with the specified letter.

-----

## 📋 Constraints

  - `1 <= n <= 15`
  - The length of each word should not exceed 100 characters.

-----

## 🧪 Sample Cases

### Sample 1

**Input:**

```
5
apple
banana
avocado
grape
orange
a
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

### Sample 2

**Input:**

```
3
cat
dog
elephant
e
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

### Sample 3

**Input:**

```
3
Bard
chatGPT
bard
b
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

*(Note: The comparison is case-sensitive. "Bard" starts with 'B', not 'b'.)*

## 💡 Solution

### Explanation

This C++ program solves the problem by first reading the number of words (`n`) and then storing all the words in a fixed-size array of strings. After the words are stored, it reads the target character. Finally, it iterates through the array of words, checks if the first character of each word (`word[0]`) matches the target letter, and increments a counter if they match. The final count is then printed to the console.

### C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    int n;
    // Read the number of words.
    std::cin >> n;

    // Use a fixed-size array for words based on the constraint (n <= 15).
    std::string words[15];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Read each word into the array.
        std::cin >> words[i];
    }

    char letter;
    // Read the target letter.
    std::cin >> letter;

    int count = 0;
    // Iterate through the array of words.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Check if the word is not empty and if its first character matches the target letter.
        if (!words[i].empty() && words[i][0] == letter) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    // Print the final count.
    std::cout << count;

    return 0;
}
```
