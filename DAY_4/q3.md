## Complexity Analysis Task 1 (Easy): Find Max Element in Array

Time Complexity: O(n)
The algorithm needs to look at every single element in the array once to be sure it has found the largest one. If the array has n elements, it performs roughly n comparisons. The runtime grows linearly with the size of the array.

Space Complexity: O(1)
The algorithm uses a fixed number of extra variables (largest, i). The amount of memory it needs does not increase as the array gets bigger. This is constant space.
