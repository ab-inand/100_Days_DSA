#### \#\# Complexity Analysis Task 2 (Medium): Nested Loops (Matrix Print)

Consider printing an `N x N` matrix:

```cpp
void printMatrix(int matrix[N][N]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {       // This loop runs N times
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {   // This loop runs N times for EACH outer loop
            std::cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}
```

  * **Time Complexity: `O(n²)`**
    The outer loop runs `n` times. For **each** of those iterations, the inner loop also runs `n` times. This means the total number of print operations is `n * n = n²`. The runtime grows quadratically with the size of the matrix dimension.
  * **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
    The algorithm only uses a few variables for loop counters (`i`, `j`). The extra memory required is constant and does not depend on the size of the matrix.
