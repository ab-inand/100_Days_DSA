#### \#\# Medium: Write a Function to Traverse and Print a Linked List

This function shows the standard pattern for iterating through a linked list from start to finish.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to traverse and print the list
void printList(Node* head) {
    // Create a temporary pointer that will move through the list.
    // We don't want to move the original 'head' pointer.
    Node* current = head;

    cout << "List: ";
    // Loop as long as our current pointer is not pointing to null
    while (current != nullptr) {
        // Print the data of the current node
        cout << current->data << " -> ";
        // Move to the next node
        current = current->next;
    }
    cout << "nullptr" << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create the list 10 -> 20 -> 30
    Node* head = new Node(10);
    head->next = new Node(20);
    head->next->next = new Node(30);

    printList(head);

    // --- Cleanup ---
    Node* current = head;
    while(current != nullptr) {
        Node* temp = current;
        current = current->next;
        delete temp;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


It's a big shift from the contiguous memory world of arrays, with fascinating trade-offs in performance for access vs. insertion/deletion. Ready to build on this new foundation\!
