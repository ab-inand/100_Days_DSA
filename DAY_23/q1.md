Here, we'll define a simple `Node` structure and then manually create and link three nodes together on the heap.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// The fundamental building block of a linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;

    // Constructor for convenience
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

int main() {
    // Manually creating a linked list: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> nullptr
    
    // 1. Create the nodes on the heap
    Node* head = new Node(10);
    Node* second = new Node(20);
    Node* third = new Node(30);

    // 2. Link them together
    head->next = second;  // The node with data 10 points to the node with data 20
    second->next = third; // The node with data 20 points to the node with data 30
    // third->next is already nullptr from the constructor

    cout << "Manually created a simple linked list." << endl;
    cout << "Head points to a node with data: " << head->data << endl;
    cout << "The next node has data: " << head->next->data << endl;

    // --- Cleanup (to prevent memory leaks) ---
    delete head;
    delete second;
    delete third;
    
    return 0;
}
```
